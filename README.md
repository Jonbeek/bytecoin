This is my attempt at making a readme while I develop, meaning that as I add
features and change things the documentation will keep up. For bytecoin I feel
that this is particularly necessary because there is a massive volume of new
cryptocurrency concepts.

Right now there is a client and a server.

The client takes the argument 'store' followed by a filename, opens a
connection to the server on port 8080 and sends the file to the server.

The server takes the file and prints it to storage.ytc
