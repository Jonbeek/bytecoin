# Nimbus Network #

The nimbus network is powered by a currency called filecoin.

## Filecoin ##

Filecoin is a proof-of-contribution cryptocurrency, where coins and blocks generated by contributing disk space and bandwidth to the nimbus network, as opposed to the bitcoin model of solving hashcash puzzles. Nodes position themselves on a DHT. Nodes contriubting more resources are responsible for larger portions of the DHT keyspace.

A hash of the previous block yields a key value for the next block. The node that is closest to the next block 'wins' that block. The bitcoin parallel is a node 'winning' by computing the hashcash that fulfills the current requirements.

The block contains an update on the status of the nimbus network.
