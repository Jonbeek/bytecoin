Why Bytecoin is Better than the Alternatives
============================================

* Bytecoin is a cryptocurrency that is backed by a commodity with market value - cloud storage. To mine bytecoins, you contribute disk storage to the bytecoin network. Stroage can be purchased off of the market using bytecoins. This means that bytecoin has inherent value, as opposed to most modern alternatives (including both bitcoin and traditional fiat) which are not backed by any inherent value. This is amazing, because the value is cryptographically guaranteed to be equivalent to the commodity value of the network.

* Bytecoin supports conditional spending, allowing you to commit money only if a certain events occured. This, combined with an awareness of other cryptocurrency networks means that people can trade between bytecoin and other currencies without an exchange in a risk free way. (if either person backs out, the transaction does not happen).

* Bytecoin will support the zero coin model for money laundering. Some would not look at this as a nice feature, but it should not impact the average user, there is no strong reason not to implement the zerocoin model.

* Bytecoin has a model for supporting instantaneous transactions - on the order of milliseconds instead of minutes. This is not included in the spec yet, but I am moderately certain that I have a few heuristics that will lead to a successful instantaneous currency.

* The cloud storage network created by bytecoin is likely to be the cheapest and most diverse cloud storage achievable with modern technology. But this will manifest in its own time. At the very least, market dynamics will prevent the price from going too far above services that provide a similar quality of cloud storage.
